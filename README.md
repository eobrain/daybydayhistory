# Day by Day History

This is a free database of historical events, which can be looked up by day.

It is currently sourced by scraping Wikipedia, but other sources might be merged later.

In addition to the data committed to the GitHub repo (in TOML format), the data is also available in these forms:

1. As JSON files, one per year
2. As CSV files (coming soon)
3. As an SQLite database file (coming soon)
4. Via a JavaScript library that can be used either on the server or in the browser

Example applications that can be built on this include:

* A this-day-in-history service.  This database was inspired by the difficulties in writing the [@delayedheadlines@botsin.space] Mastodon bot, which posts "headlines" from history.
* A timeline-of-history website
